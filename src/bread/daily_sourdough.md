## Notes
* Hyrdation: w/f = %
* (257 + 49)/(388 + 49) = 70% Hydration

## Ingredients
* 257 g room temp water
* 98 g starter (see levain below)
* 8 g salt
* 388 g bread flour

## Directions
1. Mix water and starter, add salt and stir.
2. Add flour and mix until no dry patches.
3. Cover annd let sit at room temp for 10 minutes.
4. Knead for 1 minute, shape into a ball, place in bowl and cover at room temp for 30 minutes.
5. Stretch and fold into square, then ball.
6. Cover and bulk ferment for 6 hours.
7. Preshpae into a ball and let rest uncovered for 10 minutes.
8. Shape and into banneton - rest 1 1/2 hours onthe counter.
9. Put it into the fridge overnight.
10. Preheat oven to 430 for one hour.
11. Cook covered for 20 minutes, uncovered for 30.

## Direct Notes

### The Starter (100% hydrated)
* Scrapings from the jar
* 55g Water
* 55g Flour

### Main Dough
* 388g strong white bread flour
* 257g water
* 8g salt
* 98g starter

### Directions
1. I feed my starter at 21:00 ready for the next day.

2. The next morning I add the water to a bowl and roughly dissolve the starter into it. It doesn’t need to be completely dissolved, a few bits are absolutely fine. I add the salt, give everything another quick stir before adding the flour.

I mix with a spoon again before bringing everything together into a rough dough with my hand. The dough doesn’t need to be smooth but I make sure there are no pockets of dry flour or flaky dough.

The dough has a 10-minute rest covered in the bowl, and then a 1 minute knead. After a 30-minute rest covered at room temperature, I turn the dough out and perform one set of stretch and folds (one giant lamination). I mist the worktop with water to stop the dough from sticking.

Shape the dough into a ball and leave it out, covered at room temperature to bulk ferment.

3. About six hours later the dough has expanded to about 75% of its original size, I turn the dough out onto the work surface and give it a quick pre-shape.

After a ten-minute rest uncovered, I lightly dust the banneton and top of the dough with rice flour. The dough is shaped simply into a cylindrical piece of dough and the seam is squeezed together.

I place the dough into the banneton with the seam facing upwards. It sits out at room temperature for an hour and a half uncovered.

4. Once the dough is expanding and feels springy I pop it in the fridge uncovered to ferment overnight.

5. The next morning I score the dough and bake it on a baking stone in an oven that has been pre-heated to 220c / 430f.

The bread is baked covered with a large pot for the first 20 minutes and uncovered for a final 30 minutes. I don’t use any ice or water to create steam for this loaf. It bakes just fine without it.
