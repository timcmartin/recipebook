# Meatballs

## Ingredients
* 2 slices white sandwich bread
* 1/3 cup milk
* 1 lb ground beef, bison or elk
* 1/2 lb ground pork
* 1 egg
* a small handful of flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped
* a small handful of freshly grated Parmesan
* salt and pepper

## Directions
1. Tear the bread into a bowl and pour the milk over it.
2. Allow it to sit for a few minutes, then add the beef, pork, egg, parsley and Parmesan.
3. Add some salt and pepper and mix it all up with your hands. You can do this ahead of time and keep the mixture in the fridge.
4. Shape into 1-2 inch balls and set aside on a baking sheet.
5. Carefully drop them into the simmering sauce. You might not fit them all into your pot - that's ok. Leave the rest to simmer after the first has been cooked, or freeze them for another batch.
