> I used russet potatoes last time and they turned out alright - a little hollow in the middle, but not bad.

## Ingredients
- 2 1/2 pounds of unpeeled Yukon Gold potatoes cut into fries.
- 1 1/2 litres of peanut or vegetable oil.
- Salt

## Directions
1. Cut potatoes into 1/4 inch sticks.
2. Combine potatoes and oil in large dutch oven, turn heat to high and cook until oil reaches a rolling boil, about 5 minutes.
3. Continue to cook without stirring until potatoes turn golden brown and exteriors are crisp - about 15 minutes.
4. Stir potates and cook another 5 - 10 minutes.
5. Drain on paper towels, season with salt.
