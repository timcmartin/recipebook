[Cooks Illustrated - Small Batch Blueberry Buckle](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/16401-small-batch-blueberry-buckle)

## Ingredients

### Streusel

- 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces/35 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup packed (1 3/4 ounces/50 grams) light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- Pinch table salt
- 2 tablespoons (28 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly

### Cake

- 3/4 cup (3 3/4 ounces/106 grams) all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 4 tablespoons (56 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
- 1/3 cup (2 1/3 ounces/66 grams) granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon table salt
- 1/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest
- 10 ounces (2 cups/284 grams) blueberries

## Directions

1. FOR THE STREUSEL: Combine flour, brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon,
   and salt and stir with fork until no lumps remain. Stir in melted butter
   until mixture resembles wet sand.

2. FOR THE CAKE: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350
   degrees. Spray 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pan with vegetable oil spray. Line pan
   with 10½ by 8½-inch sheet of parchment, smoothing it up long sides of pan.
   Spray parchment.

3. Whisk flour and baking powder in small bowl to combine; set aside. Combine
   melted butter, sugar, egg, vanilla, salt, and lemon zest in medium bowl and
   whisk until smooth. Add flour mixture and stir with spatula until smooth.
   Gently fold in blueberries until evenly distributed.

4. Transfer batter to prepared pan; with rubber spatula, using a pushing
   motion, spread batter evenly to pan edges and smooth surface. Squeeze
   handful of streusel in your hand to form large cohesive clump; break up clump
   with your fingers and sprinkle evenly over batter. Repeat with remaining
   streusel. Bake until deep golden brown and toothpick inserted into center of
   cake comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Let cool on wire rack for 20 minutes
   (cake will fall slightly as it cools).

5. Run paring knife along short sides of cake to loosen. Grasping parchment,
   gently lift cake from pan. Peel parchment from sides of cake and let cool
   until just warm or to room temperature, at least 30 minutes. Peel parchment
   from bottom of cake. Slice and serve.
