# Dauphinoise Potatoes

[Roman Avril](https://joinfoody.com/recipe/1307)

## Ingredients
* 5 russet potatoes (large)
* 1 cup milk 3.25%
* 1 cup cream 35%
* 3 sprigs rosemary
* 6 sprigs thyme 
* 1 teaspoon nutmeg
* 8 cloves garlic
* 1/4 cup butter
* 2 pieces shallots (peeled and diced)
* salt and pepper (to taste)
* 2 leaves bay
* 2 cups emmental

## Directions
1. In a medium saucepan,gather, gather all the ingredients listed but the potatoes and the cheese. Place it on a medium low heat to infuse for about 15-20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and store them in cold water.
3. Pass your infused cream through a sieve and discard the aromatics.
4. Line up your dish (I used a 1/3 pan) with some parchment paper and set it aside.
5. Using a Japanese mandoline on the thinnest setting slice one of your potato and start layering them making sure each potato slice overlaps.
6. Season lightly each layer with nutmeg, salt and pepper and add cheese and cream every 3 layers.
7. Preheat oven to 300F.
8. Repeat the process until you're reaching 8/10th of the dish or running out of potatoes. Press the layers so there is enough cream and they're even across.
9. Cover the last layer with parchment paper and enclose with tin foil. Place the dish overtop a tray to avoid spillage in the oven.
10. Cook the potatoes for 4 hours at 300F.
11. Remove the tin foil and plant a knife in the Dauphinoise, it should come out easily and clean. If not cook it a bit longer.
12. You could stop there and enjoy it as is. But if you know me by now, you know I like to go the extra mile.
13. If you are still with me at this point, we/re going to place another piece of parchment paper overtop then top it with a dish of the same size and press it slightly adding light weight such as a couple can of beans or tomatoes.
14. PLace in the fridge overnight.

### Final touches
1. Remove the potato Dauphinoise out of its dish, trimming the side to create a perfect rectangle and detail some 2 inches wide pavé.
2. Pre-heat your oven to 350F.
3. In a non-stick pan on medium heat, add some oil and place the pave to crisp up.
4. Add your butter, herbs and garlic and make sure it's golden brown on each side and butter baste for a couple minutes.
5. Place the pavés on a tray and in the oven at 350F for 15 minutes or until crispy and the centre's hot.
6. Brush them with a bit of the leftover butter for some extra shine, and enjoy.
7. Bon Appétit! (Full tutorial on my youtube channel).
