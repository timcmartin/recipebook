## Ingredients

### PUMPKIN SEED and BLACK COCOA STREUSEL

- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (67g)
- 1/4 cup demerara sugar (55g)
- 2 tablespoons black cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1/4 teaspoon Morton kosher salt
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces, chilled
- 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds

### PUMPKIN BATTER

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (7 oz / 200g)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder (0.21 oz / 6g)
- 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
- 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- Pinch of ground cloves
- 2 large eggs (3.5 oz / 100g), at room temperature
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar (150g)
- 1/2 cup neutral oil, such as avocado, plus more for the pan
- 1 cup canned pumpkin (8.2 oz / 232g)
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup (1.2 oz / 35g)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees
2. Grease the baking pan with the neutral oil, line the pan with a sheet of
   parchment and gently brush additional oil on top of parchment paper.

### STREUSEL

1. Mix flour, demerara sugar, kosher salt, pumpkin seeds, and black cocoa in
   medium bowl
2. Add butter to mixture and combine with finger tips until butter is mixed
   thoroughly into cocoa mixture. Cocoa will change color to dark when hydrated

### BATTER

1. Mix sugar and eggs in a large bowl vigorously until eggs turn a paler color
   compared to when you started
2. Stream oil into bowl slowly while whisking
3. Add maple syrup, pumpkin purée and vanilla; whisk until smooth.
4. Whisk in flour, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, cloves, ginger and turmeric
   until lumps are dissolved.
5. Add the batter to the pan and smooth batter flat using a spatula.
6. Crumble the streusel over the top of the batter

### BAKING

1. Place the cake in the oven for roughly 45 minutes. You cannot rely on the color
   of the cake so use a cake tester at this point to check if its ready. The cake
   should be fully cooked when the center splits and a cake tester removes
   cleanly. You can add an additional 15 minutes if it is not ready.
2. Let the cake cool for 20 minutes and then you can unmold the cake from the pan.
