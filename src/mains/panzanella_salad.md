[Cooks Illustrated - Grilled Chicken Panzanella Salad](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/16404-grilled-chicken-panzanella)

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 - 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed
- 1/3 cup tablespoons water
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 1 teaspoon plus 1/4 teaspoon table salt, divided
- 1/8 plus 1/4 teaspoon pepper, divided
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons minced shallot
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 (1-pound) loaf ciabatta, halved horizontally
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 1 1/2 pounds tomatoes, cored and cut into 3/4 inch pieces
- 1 English cucumber, quartered lengthwise and sliced 1/4 inch thick
- 8 ounces cherry-size mozzarella balls, halved
- 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, torn

## Directions

1. Slice chicken breasts in half horizontally. Whisk 1/3 cup water, fish sauce,
   honey, salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper together in small bowl. Transfer
   mixture to 1-gallon zipper-lock bag. Add chicken, press out air, seal bag, and
   turn bag so contents are evenly distributed. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.

2. While chicken marinates, whisk olive oil, vinegar, shallot, Dijon, remaining
   ¼ teaspoon salt, and remaining ¼ teaspoon pepper in large bowl; set aside.
   (Dressing can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)

3. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney
   starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are
   partially covered with ash, pour evenly over grill. Set cooking grate in place,
   cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.
   FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot,
   about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.

4. Drizzle cut sides of bread evenly with 2 tablespoons vegetable oil. Remove
   chicken from refrigerator and open 1 corner of bag to drain and discard
   excess marinade. Add remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to chicken, reseal
   bag, and turn to evenly coat.

5. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place bread, cut side down, on half of grill.
   Place chicken, skinned side down, on other half of grill. Cook (covered if
   using gas) until bread is well browned and charred at edges, 2 to 4 minutes,
   moving as needed to ensure even browning. Cook chicken until dark grill marks
   develop and breasts register 160 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer
   bread and chicken to cutting board; let rest for at least 5 minutes.

6. Cut bread and chicken into ¾-inch pieces. Rewhisk dressing to combine and
   add bread, chicken, tomatoes, and cucumber, tossing to evenly coat. Season
   with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to serving platter and top with
   mozzarella and basil. Serve.
