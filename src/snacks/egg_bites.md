# Egg Bites

> 14 eggs works perfect for my silicone muffin pans.

## Ingredients
* 18 eggs
* 1 cup full fat cottage cheese
* 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
* 1 tsp pepper
* 1 tsp salt
* Bacon, chives, whatever...

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 300 and place a brownie tray with water into the oven.
2. Add eggs, cheese and seasoning to a food processor or blender and blend until smooth - not too fast, and try not to incorporate too much air.
3. Pour the egg mixture into 24 silicone muffin cups - about halfway up.  Add your extras.
4. Bake for about 30 minutes - until completely set.
