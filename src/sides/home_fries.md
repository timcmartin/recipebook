# Home Fries
> If you need to double this recipe, instead of crowding the skillet, cook two batches of home fries separately. While you make the second batch, the first can be kept hot and crisp by spreading them on a cookie sheet and placing them in a 300-degree oven. The paprika adds a warm, deep color, but can be omitted. An alternative is to toss in 1 tablespoon minced parsley just before serving the potatoes.

## Ingredients
* 2 1/2	tablespoons corn oil or peanut oil
* 1	medium onion, chopped small
* 1	pound Yukon Gold potatoes (2 medium) or all-purpose potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (see below)
* 1 1/4	teaspoons table salt
* 1	tablespoon unsalted butter
* 1	teaspoon paprika

## Directions
1. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add onion and saut√©, stirring frequently, until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer onion to small bowl and set aside.
2. Meanwhile, place diced potatoes in large saucepan, cover with 1/2 inch water, add 1 teaspoon salt, and place over high heat. As soon as water begins to boil, about 6 minutes, drain potatoes thoroughly in colander.
3. Heat butter and remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until butter foams. Add potatoes and shake skillet to evenly distribute potatoes in single layer; make sure that one side of each piece is touching surface of skillet. Cook without stirring until potatoes are golden brown on bottom, about 4 to 5 minutes, then carefully turn potatoes with wooden spatula. Spread potatoes in single layer in skillet again and repeat process until potatoes are tender and browned on most sides, turning three to four times, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Add onions, paprika, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste; stir to blend and serve immediately.
