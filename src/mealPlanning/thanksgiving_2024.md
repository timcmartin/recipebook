# Thanksgiving 2024

## Notes

- Cooked turkey on the charcoal grill without adding any wood chunks. It had a
  pleasant amount of smoke.
- Took about 2 1/2 hours (kept it between 350 and 400)

## Methods

### Turkey

- Used Dan's ATK Dry Brine:
  - 4 Tbs salt
  - 4 tsp sugar
  - Turkey glove - separate skin from breasts and legs.
  - use 4 tsp of mix on each breast, tsp each leg, rest inside the cavity.
  - Let dry uncovered in the fridge on a rack in a baking sheet for 24 - 48
    hours (I did 24)
- I tried the Baking Soda / oil brush on top - the bird looked good but there
  was some weird residue I didn't like. Try just oil next time.
- Charcoal Grill:
  - Lit it about 1:00
  - Turkey on around 1:30 - 2
  - 350 - 400, took 2 1/2 hours

### Stuffing

- Used [this recipe](../sides/stuffing.md). It was excellent.
  - Did not grease dish, cooked for 45 minutes - was perfect, do not go a
    minute longer.

### Gravy

- [Game Changing Gravy](condiments/turkey_gravy.md#CIGravy)

### Mashed Potatoes

- 1/2 pound of butter, large Boursin, a little heavy cream

### Rolls

- Made [Jason's Grandma's 2 hour buns](../sides/buns.md)
- Silicon muffin tray needs to be sprayed!
- They are smaller than my old one - try making 24 instead of 12.

## Planning

  - Strained and simmered uncovered to reduce a bit.
