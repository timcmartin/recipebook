> Tastes kinda like a Filet-o-fish.  Found the patties a little thick and soft - try making patties a little thinner next time.

## Ingredients
* 1 cup panko bread crumbs
* 1 1/4 pounds peeled and deveined large shrimp (26 to 30 per pound), tails removed
* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 3 scallions, chopped fine
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 4 hamburger buns
* 4 leaves Bibb lettuce

## Directions
1. Pulse panko in food processor until finely ground, about 15 pulses; transfer to shallow dish.
2. Place one-third of shrimp (1 cup), mayonnaise, pepper, salt, and cayenne in now-empty processor and pulse until shrimp are finely chopped, about 8 pulses.
3. Add remaining two-thirds of shrimp (2 cups) to shrimp mixture in processor and pulse until coarsely chopped, about 4 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.
4. Transfer shrimp mixture to bowl and stir in scallions.
5. Divide shrimp mixture into four 3/4-inch-thick patties (about 1/2 cup each). Working with 1 patty at a time, dredge both sides of patties in panko, pressing lightly to adhere, and transfer to plate.
6. Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Place patties in skillet and cook until golden brown on first side, 3 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip and continue to cook until shrimp registers 140 to 145 degrees and second side is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer.
7. Transfer burgers to paper towelâ€“lined plate and let drain, about 30 seconds per side. Spread tartar sauce on bun bottoms, then place burgers, more tartar sauce and lettuce on top. Cover with bun tops. Serve.
