## Topping

### Topping Ingredients

- 2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (not quick-cooking)
- 1/2 cup (67g) all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup (67g) granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup (67g) demerara sugar
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 12 tablespoons (6 oz) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2 inch pieces, chilled

## Filling

### Filling Ingredients

- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 4 tablespoons (2oz) unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 2 tablespoons (or a generous splash) of heavy cream
- 3 lbs. sweet-tart apples such as honey crisp or pink lady (6-7 medium)
  peeled, cut into wedges
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- Vanilla ice cream, for serving

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350.
2. Put topping ingredients in a bowl and work until the butter is thoroughly
   combined (a la wet sand). Place in fridge (can be made a few days ahead).
3. Peel, core and slice apples.
4. Make a dry caramel by heating sugar in a skillet.
5. When melted, off heat add butter and stir. Add cream and stir.
6. Add half of the apples and cook until starting to wilt.
7. Add the rest of the apples and cook until no longer stiff.
8. Make a slurry with the cornstarch and a little bit of water, add to pan and
   bring mixture to a boil to activate the starch.
9. When liquid is bound, take off heat and flatten apples. Top with crumble and
   bake at 350 for 40 - 50 minutes.
