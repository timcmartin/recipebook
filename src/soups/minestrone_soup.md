[J. Kenji Lopez-Alt](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-minestrone-soup-recipe)

## Ingredients

- 4 ounces (115g) salt pork or pancetta, cut into 1/4-inch dice (optional)
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 6 ounces; 175g)
- 1 medium carrot, peeled and finely diced (about 3 ounces; 85g)
- 2 celery stalks, finely diced (about 3 ounces; 85g)
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) minced fresh rosemary leaves
- 2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons; 12g)
- 1 pound (450g) ripe Roma tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped
- 2 cups of canned cannellini beans
- 1 Parmesan rind

### To Finish

- 1 cup dried small pasta, such as ditali(about 3 1/2 ounces; 100g)
- 1 medium zucchini, cut into bite-size pieces (about 4 ounces; 115g)
- 1 medium summer squash, cut into bite-size pieces (about 4 ounces; 115g)
- 4 ounces green beans, cut into 1/2-inch lengths (about 115g)
- 4 ounces spinach, roughly chopped (about 4 cups loosely packed leaves; 115g)
- Chopped fresh herbs, such as basil, parsley, or rosemary, for serving
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Heat pancetta (if using) and olive oil in a large Dutch oven or stockpot
   over medium-high heat.
2. Cook, stirring, until pancetta has rendered fat and softened, but has not
   yet browned. (If omitting pancetta, heat oil just until shimmering.)
3. Add onion, carrot, celery, and minced rosemary. Season with a big pinch of
   salt and cook, stirring, until vegetables are softened but not browned, 10
   to 15 minutes, adding more oil if pot appears dry or if vegetables are starting
   to stick to the bottom.
4. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add
   tomatoes and cook, stirring, until most of their moisture has evaporated and
   the mixture starts to fry. (The sound should change from a sputtering simmering
   sound to a sharper crackle as vegetables start to fry.) Add reserved
   bean-cooking liquid, beans, and Parmesan rind, if using. Let broth simmer for
   at least 10 minutes.
5. Add Parmesan Rind and drain and rinse 2 cups of canned beans and add them to
   the soup, along with 2 quarts of homemade vegetable stock, or store-bought
   or homemade low-sodium chicken stock. Let simmer for 30 minutes before
   proceeding to step 6.
6. Add pasta (unless you are planning on simmering for a long time; see step
   7), zucchini, squash, and green beans and simmer until pasta and vegetables
   are tender, about 10 minutes. Add spinach and cook, stirring occasionally,
   until spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes. Discard Parmesan rind, if used.
7. Serve soup immediately as is, or continue simmering for up to 2 1/2 hours
   for a heartier texture and flavor (if simmering for a long time, add the
   pasta 10 to 15 minutes before serving). Alternatively, reserve half of soup on
   the side, continue to simmer the other half in the pot for up to 2 1/2 hours,
   and stir reserved soup back in for a soup that is hearty, but still has plenty
   of bright vegetable flavor and texture. Stir in chopped herbs and season to
   taste with salt and pepper before serving.
